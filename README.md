# IPO Data Dictionary
This repository contains the data model for the Indiana Precision Oncology (IPO) Data Commons, which is deployed using the Gen3 data commons platform.

For general information about dictionaries in Gen3, see the [Gen3 Data Dictionaries](https://gen3.org/resources/user/dictionary/) documentation.

Check out the appropriate version and use the Gen3 [dictionaryutils](https://github.com/uc-cdis/dictionaryutils) to create a schema.json file that can be deployed in Gen3.

For step-by-step instructions on how to make changes to the dictionary, please see the `development` guide in the `DOCS` folder.
